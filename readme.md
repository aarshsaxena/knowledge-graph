## Automated Knowledge Graph Construction from Structured Documents
This project develops an AI-powered system for automatically constructing a knowledge graph from structured documents. The system extracts entities, relationships, and properties from various document formats (PDF, text, and images) and visualizes the graph.

## Features
- Schema Inference: Automatically deduces entities, relationships, and properties from structured documents.
- Multi-Format Support: Handles text, PDFs, and images.
- Dynamic Graph Construction: Builds and visualizes a dynamic knowledge graph.
- Extensibility: Adaptable to different domains and document types.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language.
- spaCy: NLP library for entity and relationship extraction.
- networkx: For building and visualizing the knowledge graph.
- matplotlib: For graph visualization.
- pdfplumber: Extracts text from PDF documents.
- pytesseract: OCR tool for extracting text from images.
